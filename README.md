###Com0Com.CSharp
This is a C# wrapper for the com0com null-modem emulator.

At this time, the following features are implemented:
* Create a null-modem com port pair
* Remove a null-modem com port pair
* Get all null-modem com port pairs

There are plans in the future to wrap com2tcp, but who knows what that will happen :)

This assembly is available on nuget.
